#### The hybrid work premium: Do remote-friendly firms outperform across sectors?​
This project investigates whether companies that adopted remote or hybrid work models after COVID-19 outperformed office-first firms in terms of stock returns and financial performance. The goal is to identify whether there's a measurable “remote work premium” associated with flexible work policies.
